#Points on the line
'''A line in 2-dimensional plane is represented as an equation a*x+b*y+c=0, where `a’ is called the coefficient of x, 
`b’ is called as the coefficient of y and `c’ is the constant term. Here a,b, c are all real numbers. 
A point in a 2-dimensional plane is represented as a pair of numbers (x1, y1), where x1 and y1 are both real numbers 
and x1 is called as the x-coordinate of the point , y1 is called as the y-coordinate of the point.

A point (x1,y1) will lie  on a line if a*(x1) +b ( y1) +c =0. Consider the line 2*x+3*y-1=0. T
he point (-1,1) is a point on the line : 2*x+3*y-1=0 since 2* (-1) +3*(1)-1=0.

Given an equation of the line a*x+b*y+c=0 and an integer n, write an algorithm and the subsequent code to print n points on the 
line such that the x-coordinates of all the n-points are the odd integers 1,3,5,7,…. respectively. Among the n-points , 
x-coordinate of the first point is 1, x-coordinate of the second point is 3, x-coordinate of the third point is 5 and so on. 
Your code should print the y-coordinates of all the n-points that lie on the given line. All the real numbers are represented in the 2-decimal format.

Let the equation of the line 2*x + 3 * y -15 =0, 3 points which lie on this line, are required such that the 
x-coordinate of the first point is 1, the x-coordinate of the second point is 3, x-coordinate of the third point is 5.

Here 2*1+3*4.33-15=0. Hence, the point (1,4.33) lie on the line

2*3 +3*(3.00)-15=0. Hence, the point (3,3.00) lie on the line

2*5 +3*(1.67)-15=0. Hence the point (5, 1.67) lie on the line.

Hence, your program should output 4.33, 3.00. 1.67

Note: To print the only decimal places of value of a variable answer, syntax to be used in Python is 

print(format(answer,'0.2f'))

Input format :

First line contains the coeeficient of x, a
Second line contains the coefficient of y, b
Third line contains the value of constant term , c
Fourth line contains the number of points required , n

Output format:

First line contains the y-coordinate of the first point
Second line contains y-coordinate of the second point
nth line contains y-coordinate of the n-th point
